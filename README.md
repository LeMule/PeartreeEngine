# PeartreeEngine
A base for making games? ... Eventually. Don't mind the mess!

**Batteries Included**
Third Party Libraries in use...
  - assimp-5.0.1
  - glad
  - glfw-3.3.2
  - glm

Platforms...
  - Windows (YES)
  - Linux (Intended. Untested.)
  - MAC ( Probably Not :) )

Compilers...

Major TODOs...
  - BETTER ABSTRACTIONS...
  - Probably just revisit most of the code.. Yeah. We have decent proofs of concept though!
  - Integrate "self compiler" for the game development portion.
  - XMLParser
  - An ACTUAL BaseGame/GDK (No plans on going down the editor route)
  - Would be cool to write our own math lib :)
