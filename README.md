# PeartreeEngine
A base for making games? ... Eventually. Don't mind the mess!

**Batteries Included**
Third Party Libraries in use...
  - assimp-5.0.1
  - glad
  - SDL
  - glm
  - KHR
  - stb_image

Platforms...
  - Windows (YES)
  - Linux (Intended. Untested.)
  - MAC ( Probably Not :) )

Compilers...
  - clang (YES)
  - MSVC (YES)
  - gcc (Untested.)

Major TODOs...
  - BETTER ABSTRACTIONS...
  - Integrate "self compiler" for the game development portion.
    - This would be some kind of scripting engine to speed up dev. (Maybe not worth the effort)
  - XMLParser (better/faster?)
  - An ACTUAL BaseGame/GDK (No plans on going down the editor route)
  - Would be cool to write our own math lib :)
  - Physics/Collisions!
